# Causal Inference

## This repo provides fast probabilistic inference over Bayesian Networks

## This is built on top of networkx.  The main goal is to be able to do large scale inference and learning on graphical models.

### Short term todo list:
- Finsh inference instructions
- Add batching scheme
- Implement discrete states
- Implement continuous states
